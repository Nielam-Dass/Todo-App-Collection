# TODO-App-Collection

This repository contains many different TODO apps that are built using a variety of tech stacks. The purpose of creating these apps is to become familiar with a wide range of frameworks, tools, libraries, and languages used in software engineering. Most of these apps will NOT be deployed long-term. However, experimental short-term deployments are likely.
